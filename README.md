# management
Organization management pilot/prototype. 


Código Bonito is a not-for-profit-nor-really-anything-legally-speaking org in Brazil. 

It is lots of fun. It has been stalled for a few years, but the GitHub org still has very nice people in it. 

I needed an org to explore org team management on GitHub, so I am using this org. 

Hopefully this is useful for others.
